# Calling for collaborators on this free open source project

Looking for any interested Designers / Developers to help collaborate on this open source project. It would help if you were good (Qlder) but any level of talent (NSW have lots, just lacking in results department) would be appreciated.

Specifically after:
- developers with interest in data/DB/SQL
- designers who want to own the overall look and feel.

All games from 1982. Currently renders out series wins, matches within series wins and total points scored.

Built with [Three JS](http://threejs.org/) using WebGL. There is also a SVG renderer (currently hidden - almost ready) built with [d3](http://d3js.org/) which could be be a fallback if WebGL is not available.

PS. Maroon rhymes with moon, not own.

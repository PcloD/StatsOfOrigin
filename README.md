# StatsOfOrigin - State of Origin Visualiser
**3d Visualiser for the State of Origin as used on StatsOfOrigin.com (originally OriginStats.com)**

All games from 1982. Currently renders out series wins, matches within series wins and total points scored.

Built with [Three JS](http://threejs.org/) using WebGL. There is also a SVG renderer (currently hidden) built with [d3](http://d3js.org/) which could be be a fallback if WebGL is not available.

PS. Maroon rhymes with moon, not own.
